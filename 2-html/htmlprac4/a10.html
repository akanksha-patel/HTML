			 To implement a modifiable collection, the programmer must additionally override this class's add method (which otherwise throws an UnsupportedOperationException), and the iterator returned by the iterator method must additionally implement its remove method. The programmer should generally provide a void (no argument) and Collection constructor, as per the recommendation in the Collection interface specification.
