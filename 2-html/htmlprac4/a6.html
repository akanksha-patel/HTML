		This class provides a skeletal implementation of the Collection interface, to minimize the effort required to implement this interface.                        
		
		<br /><br /><br /><br />
		
		To implement an unmodifiable collection, the programmer needs only to extend this class and provide implementations for the iterator and size methods. (The iterator returned by the iterator method must implement hasNext and next.)
